# Thoughts
## Environment
The environment file contains the things that define the game. It has a poker table class.
Different games could be defined by defining different tables. This table class also controls how the players interact 
with the game. 

All the code for the terminal print statements should be held in table class. This allows for clean 
segregation of responsibilities.
